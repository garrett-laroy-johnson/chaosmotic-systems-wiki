# Chaosmotic Systems

**Chaosmotic Systems: Culture, Cosmology, Computation** is an MFA-level seminar taught by Garrett Laroy Johnson. It was taught for the first time at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the Art Technology / Sound Practices department during Fall 2024 semester. The course materials are public and can be accessed [here](https://practices.digital/saic/mfa5010). 

This repository serves as an entry point for the course's collaborative wiki project. Students will contribute (5) 500-word articles about concepts, authors, 


## Installation

### GitHub
GitHub Desktop is how you will grab changes ("fetch" and "pull", in Git terminology) made by classmates and then contribute your own material ("commit" and "push" in Git terminology. This workflow is setup so that your changes will automatically be reflected on the live and public wiki website after about a 15-minute delay. 

1. Students should first make a GitHub account and download the GitHub desktop client. You can do both at [www.github.com](www.github.com). 
2. Open GitHub Desktop, Go to settings and sign in.
3. Copy the URL to this page. Go to file > clone repository. *Note the location of the cloned repository, you will use it below*. 

### Obsidian
Obsidian is where you will add to the Wiki on your own machine. Changes made on your own machine in Obsidian *will not* be automatically sync'd to the website (more on that soon). 

1. Download [Obsidian]([url](https://obsidian.md/)).
2. Open the program and click "open folder as vault". This is where you need the location of your cloned repository `.../chaosmotic-systems/content`.
3. Edit away! You may want to consult some tutorials on Obsidian if you need help getting started, but it is really very straight forward. 

## Getting GitHub Privleges 

You will not be allowed to make changes to the GitHub by default. You need to send your username to the course TA, who will manually add you as a collaborator. Do this sooner rather than later!
