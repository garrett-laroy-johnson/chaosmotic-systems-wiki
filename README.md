## Installation

### GitHub
GitHub Desktop is how you will grab changes ("fetch" and "pull", in Git terminology) made by classmates and then contribute your own material ("commit" and "push" in Git terminology. This workflow is setup so that your changes will automatically be reflected on the live and public wiki website after about a 15-minute delay. 

1. Students should first make a GitHub account and download the GitHub desktop client. You can do both at [www.github.com](www.github.com). 
2. Open GitHub Desktop, Go to settings and sign in.
3. Copy the URL to this page. Go to file > clone repository. *Note the location of the cloned repository, you will use it below*. 

### Obsidian
Obsidian is where you will add to the Wiki on your own machine. Changes made on your own machine in Obsidian *will not* be automatically sync'd to the website (more on that soon). 

1. Download [Obsidian]([url](https://obsidian.md/)).
2. Open the program and click "open folder as vault". This is where you need the location of your cloned repository `.../chaosmotic-systems/content`
